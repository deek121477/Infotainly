      <h3 class="w3-center">Internship Approach and Scholarships</h3>
      <p class="w3-center w3-large"><strong>By Shristi Jalan</strong></p>

<div class="container-fluid p-5  content" >
<p>   
    AICVS Cummins came up with the amazing concept of webinars to knockdown this lockdown! Through these webinar series they attempted to cover a wide range of discussions by bringing extremely talented student speakers over these 6 informative webinars. One of the webinar conducted on was spanning over the topic “Internship Approach and Scholarships” and the speaker for the same was Shristi Jalan.<br>
    <br>
    The speaker, Shristi Jalan, is a graduate in Information technology from Cummins College of Engineering. Shristi was a Summer Intern at Goldman Sachs for year 2019 and also the recipient of the WeTech Goldman Sachs Global Scholarship, the Mentorship Program Award and also the Cummins Scholarship. She also interned as a UI/UX developer at HACKEDEMIST. She was a participant in the Code Club at IIT Bombay. Shristi’s key interests being ML, BI, Cloud Computing, DBMS, Data Structures, she has completed many projects aligning to the same; like Chat-Bot development using Google Assistant. A Seminar based on NLP was also conducted by her. She is the Crowd Source Campus representative and was also a mentor for SWE. Her responsibilities not only being limied to that, they also include the position of Public relations Assistant held by her at a Volunteering Organization Bhumi.<br>
    <br>
    Shristi at her attempt to bridge the gap between the juniors and the Alumni of the College guided the juniors and undergrads about how to approach internships, placements and scholarships and also had informative QnA sessions.<br>
    <br>
  
    Moving ahead in the webinar she touched upon the very crucial and persistent question among the undergrads – <strong>HOW TO BEGIN WITH CODING?</strong> Many useful resources were mentioned by her in order to resolve this question. She suggested CS50 – online course by Harvard , which takes us through the basics of the coding languages and lays a sound foundation to start coding. She stressed upon not underestimating the college courses and lab assignments, which many if the undergrads tend to do :P. She also mentioned YouTube as a big help in this process as it has a lot of free and self-paced courses/channels which all the undergrads can take up easily. She also mentioned the resources like Udacity and Coursera which come into picture when basic are in place!
    <br><br>
    Next up she went on the taboo question 
  
    <h3> WHAT IF I AM A NON CS STUDENT?</h3> 
    “No barrier of the branch” said Shristi just as she began to address this question. Lot of companies are looking for and offering jobs related to CS to the people of varied domains who don’t belong to CS background. The effort put in by these people is a bit more than the CS students but that just worth it when you receive the job of your liking! Practice is the key she mentioned and suggested Geeks For Geeks as a useful platform for the same. She also suggested the build on additional Mathematical knowledge and other E&TC projects including IoT would be a great asset in this journey of a NON CS to CS job!
    <br><br>
 
    
    <h3> WHAT SKILLS ARE NEEDED?</h3>
    
    She mentioned basic math and logic will take you a long way in the process and benefit you largely in the placement process. Although the skills demanded by the companies could be specific to company, there are a few key technical skills that are common to all– Problem solving, Data Structures and Algorithms, DBMS, Operating Systems and Networking. In short, the curriculum of 3 – 4 undergrad years at college! :P She then covered the a very crucial point – WHAT LANGUAGE IS PREFFERED? In which she conveyed clearly any and every programming language which you are comfortable with works fine. Personally she recommended Python and Java. Do not switch between languages frequently was a key take away from this point and addition to that was using online coding platforms like Hackerrank. She also talked about WHAT IS THE DIFFICULTY LEVEL OF CODE? which is very specific to the company. In general, she mentioned the difficulty level lies between medium to hard and the evaluation factors could be number of test cases cleared and optimization (although the evaluation metrics might change according to companies, every year). She personally recommended to begin with C and then move on to Java, C++, Python and basic coding logic always stays the same irrespective of the language used! DO’s AND DON’Ts were also specified by her while doing your preparation which provided a lot of insights to the undergrads on what should be their approach for all this and gave them a clear picture of what they should not do! (Memorizing the code being on the top of the DON’Ts list). She also shared some tips on how to manage the preparation when you have less time in hand for preparation, which obviously helped a lot to the juniors from time management perspective!
    <br><br>
    Moving on Shristi gave valuable tips on RESUME - DO’s AND DON’Ts which covered key points like keeping your resume ready well in advance, and the only main take away of this point was – <strong> DO NOT LIE ABOUT ANY POINT IN YOUR RESUME, BE HONEST WITH WHAT YOU HAVE ON IT AND KEEP IT CONCISE!</strong> While she talked about COMPANY BACKGROUND PREPARATION, she suggested checking out company website, their products and services, domains the work in, their LinkedIn updates, and knowing about founders and prominent leaders in the company.

        <h3>WHAT COMPANIES LOOK FOR?</h3>


        In general, Shristi mentioned honest, hardworking people with sound problem solving and communication skills and ability to work as a team player were all the major qualities companies look for while they hire students. Technical rounds might vary in number and pattern she mentioned, as they are subject to a particular company and their way of executing hiring process. Main tips for these from Shristi’s end for this were – think but think out loud and explain the logic and then start working on the code. WHAT TYPE OF QUESTIONS COULD BE ASKED? Is again a company specific point she mentioned but again gave a generalized idea about the range of questions – from array manipulation to Dynamic programming, from stack to queue to trees spanning over entire the data structure and algorithms! Another important tip received from her end was on HOW TO TACKLE A SITUATION WHERE YOU DON’T KNOW AN ANSWER? – It is okay to not know the answer, just accept it gracefully and take them through your thought process and explain as much as you know! You might even be right! :P But do not lie and sound overconfident in such situation, mentioned Shristi. Also, she touched upon a major common questions of HR rounds like INTRODUCE YOURSELF, WHERE DO YOU SEE YOURSELF IN 5 YEARS, WHY SHOULD WE HIRE YOU and gave really very useful inputs on the same! Being honest, confident, vocal about your strengths at the same time being aware of your own weaknesses, and leaving a good first impression were the key take away points from this. And she suggested to definitely go for asking questions to the interviewer, given a chance for the same. Do not shy away and stay quiet! Express your curiosity in a subtle way and channel it well via professional guidelines. WHAT IS THE KEY TO CONFIDENCE? – Shristi mentioned confidence is not an inborn quality, it a product of your struggles and challenges you’ve overcame! It is a learnable skill, which comes with preparedness and practice. Being aware of strengths contributes largely to it :)
        <br><br>
        Lastly, Shristi took up some questions and took time to address each one of it in detail and gave more ‘cherries on cake’ with every questions! Check out the webinar for getting to know the same! To end this webinar, Shristi fondly said few genuine words for the undergrads and subtly got the crux of the entire session in these – Be patient, confident and honest - it takes you a long way, be positive and interactive. Practice well and attempt to learn always,<strong> MAINLY FROM THE PROCESS!</strong>
